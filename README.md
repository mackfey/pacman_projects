# Aritificial Intelligence: Pacman Projects

University of Washington CSEP 573 Artificial Intelligence - Winter 2024

This contains Pac-Man projects which were adapted from UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence class. It explores several techniques of Artificial Intelligence such as Searching, Heuristics, Adversarial Behaviour, Reinforcement Learning etc.

**Project 1: Search** - DFS, BFS, UCS, Greedy Search, A* Search


**Project 2: MultiAgent** - minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax


**Project 3: Markov Decision Processes & Reinforcement Learning** - Value Iteration, Q-learning, Approximate Q-learning


**Project 4: Ghostbusters** - Hidden Markov Model, Bayes Net, Particle Filtering.
